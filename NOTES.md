CLI Essentials *

Ruby Essentials *
[X]  Basic control flow - how "if" statements work
  Variable scopes - method, instance and class
  Object instantiation - #new (and possibly #initialize)
  The meaning of the "self" keyword
  Method types - class vs. instance methods
  Method return types - knowing what methods return
  Iterating through collections - at least using #each with a block
